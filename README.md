Web Chat Application
This is a real-time web-based chat application built using Node.js, Express, and Socket.IO. The app allows users to engage in instant messaging, send text messages, and upload files.

Features
Real-time Messaging: Users can send and receive messages instantly through WebSockets (via Socket.IO).
File Upload: Users can send and receive files with a simple click on the file upload button.
Username Customization: Users can enter a custom username, which is stored for the duration of their session.
Simple User Interface: A clean and intuitive interface for sending and receiving messages and managing contacts.
Technologies Used
Node.js: Server-side runtime environment to handle HTTP requests and WebSocket connections.
Express: Web framework for building the server and handling routes.
Socket.IO: Real-time communication library to handle WebSocket connections.
HTML/CSS: For structuring and styling the frontend.
JavaScript: For frontend interactivity and socket communication.
